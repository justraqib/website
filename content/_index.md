I am a Raqib Ahmed — a Software Engineer at [OpenMined](https://openmined.org/). This platform serves as my open notebook, chronicling my journey and experiences in programming, cloud computing, microcontrollers, and the Internet of Things. This site is currently in the process of migrating from Wordpress to Zola, so things are temporarily unavailable.

Meanwhile, feel free to reach out and start a conversation!
